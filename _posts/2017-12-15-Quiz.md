Yesterday, we worked on the computer on a paper lab and other work. Today, we had a quiz.

## Today I Observed:

Mr. Fong dipped a $20 bill into a solution of salt, alcohol, and water. Then he lit the bill on fire. The bill did not come out as burned. Why? It is the solution that let it burn, and made sure the bill was not burned.

- salt: used to make sure the flame is bright and orange.
- alcohol: the fuel for the flame
- water: used to absorb the thermal energy from the flame, and prevent it from getting to the bill. The water evaporates, leaving the bill untouched. 
- After the solution is burned/evaporated, the flame stops.
