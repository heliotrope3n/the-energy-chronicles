Today, we used the clickers to learn about thermal energy. We also got time to work on some practice thermal energy questions.

## Today I learned

In terms of calculating the heat of an ice cube in its transformation to water, there are three steps that are required. First, using q = mct we can calculate the energy gained from the ice state to the temperature of 0 degrees Celsius, the freezing point. Second, using q = ml the energy needed for the state change can be calculated. Lastly, using q = mct , the ice, now water, the energy needed to reach the final temperature can be calculated.

Most of what we did today was review from yesterday, please check yesterday's post for that. We also did worksheets which involved changes of state, using the q=ml and q=mct equations.

I also watched videos on nuclear energy today, and learned that there are many types of nuclear energy. Fission is what we have right now, but fusion could be the future. Fission energy involves blasting atoms at another atom, and it splits an atom: in that process, lots of energy is created for very little material. However, there are many drawbacks, like the dangerous radioactive waste it creates. Fusion energy is almost like a star, and it will produce near infinite energy. However, it is quite difficult to produce and will require a lot of research.

## Something intriguing

Mist on your skin will cool you down, and I realized that is the same effect as sweating. When you sweat, it will evaporate and bring away some of the heat that you had.

## After Unit Reflection

This post connects to requirement #5f for nuclear energy. It summarizes the processes for fission, the potential for fusion, and drawbacks for both. The videos were quite interesting, they showed the many extreme positives and extreme negatives for nuclear energy.

This post also connects to requirement #4 for solving energy transformation problems. It solves some problems involving state changes, which involve energy transfers from another object.
