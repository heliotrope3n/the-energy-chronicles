Today, we used the clickers to learn about thermal energy. We also got time to work on some practice thermal energy questions.

## Today I learned

In terms of calculating the heat of an ice cube in its transformation to water, there are three steps that are required. First, using q = mct we can calculate the energy gained from the ice state to the temperature of 0 degrees Celsius, the freezing point. Second, using q = ml the energy needed for the state change can be calculated. Lastly, using q = mct , the ice, now water, the energy needed to reach the final temperature can be calculated.

Most of what we did today was review from yesterday, please check yesterday's post for that.

## Something intriguing

Mist on your skin will cool you down, and I realized that is the same effect as sweating. When you sweat, it will evaporate and bring away some of the heat that you had.
