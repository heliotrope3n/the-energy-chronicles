Short post today, we did a lab in class. This involved setting up a ramp and a photogate, and rolling marbles down the ramp. We were to measure the final velocities, and eventually measure the energy transformations. I also completed energy calculation problems on [braingenie.ck12.org](http://braingenie.ck12.org/) for practice.

## Today I learned:

My hand isn't exactly the most perfect tool to use to drop the ball. There will always be some variances.

The energy problems also use a lot of kinematics
