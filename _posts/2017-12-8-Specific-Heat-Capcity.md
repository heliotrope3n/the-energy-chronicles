We worked on Gizmos today.

## Today I learned:

1. Specific heat capacity is the energy needed to heat one kg of substance by one kelvin. Heat capacity is the energy needed to heat a mass up by one kelvin. The specific heat capacity of water is 4.184 J/kgK.

2. More heat capacity means more resistance to change in temperature. When in contact with another object, the equilibrium will be closer to the object with higher heat capacity.

3. A calorimeter is a device that can be used to measure the heat capcity of an object.

## Today I wondered:

In which state of matter would it have the most heat capacity? Or does it not matter?

How can we relate heat energy to kinetic and mechanical energy? It's not as easily converted.

## Today I had an intriguing idea:

Objects at or close to absolute zero can have a temperature of very little. But, they could potentially have a very large heat capacity.
