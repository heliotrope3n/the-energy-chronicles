Unfortunately, Mr. Fong was not here today. We were in the computer lab, and using the results from the marble and ramp lab that we did a few days ago, we processed it, graphed it, and analyzed it.

## Today I learned:

The final velocity is proportional to the square root of the height of the ramp when rolling a ball down the ramp. The slope will be the square root of 2gh.

Using Google Sheets, I cannot make error bars of different values.

We evaluate the results of an experiment against a target, and then we calculate the uncertainty. We then need to try and explain the rest of the uncertainty, for example friction when rolling the ball down the ramp.

## Today I wondered:

Does it matter whether I change the x values or the y values when linearizing? It appears x is the convention, but what difference does it make?

Do I need to include error bars if they are barely visible?
