Today I was not actually in physics class, however I was hosting an inter-school chess tournament in our school library. During this time, we were playing chess, but an interesting thought came to my head towards the end of the day. When playing chess, our brains use the chemical energy stored in our bodies and uses it to process the position, consider options, and do other calculations, etc. However, no visible movement is done in real life, so in physics no work is done. This is another example of using energy, but 'wasting' it in physics. Just like pushing the wall, no 'physics' work was done but energy was expended.
